    "question": "Why does the instantaneous rate of reaction not change when a part of the reacting solution is taken out?",
    "solution": "Because instantaneous rate is measured over a very small interval of time, it remains unaffected when a portion of the solution is removed."

    "solution": "Rate of reaction is defined as the change in concentration of reactants or products per unit time."
